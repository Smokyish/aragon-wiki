    ## Step 4. Running the livestream

    1. Open designated [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si) channel (currently [aragondev](https://meet.jit.si/aragondev)), and paste the notes hackmd document.

    2. Start livestream in Jitsi when the meeting is scheduled to start.

    3. Welcome viewers and participants on the call. “Before we begin..” Designate a note taker if one has not volunteered already. Tell everyone on the call that a link to the notes is in the Jitsi chat, and anyone is welcome to add notes as well.

        - Document meeting attendees, agenda items, notes from discussions.

    4. Do roll call and introduce anyone new to the call.

    5. Run through each agenda item and pass to item owner to lead. Conclude each item discussion by repeating and documenting action items.

    6. Keep meeting running on time. The goal is to have all agenda items addressed by the scheduled end time.

    7. If all agenda items are covered before the scheduled end time, the meeting is done early.

    8. Thank participants and viewers for attending, then stop the livestream.
