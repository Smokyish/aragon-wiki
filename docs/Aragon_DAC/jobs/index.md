# Aragon DAC Jobs

<img src="../../design/logo/aragon_dac/Logo_ad.png" style="width:75%">

As part of the ongoing efforts to build out the Aragon infrastructure, the Aragon Foundation and Giveth are building the Aragon DAC, a Decentralized Altruistic Community run using the Giveth DApp building out core Aragon infrastructure from the end user's perspective. ¬†Read more about our formation [here](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-dac-a-new-community-effort-to-foster-aragons-development-led-by-giveth/).

We are currently building 2 teams that will work closely together. The first is the Community R&D Campaign that will help end-users (=non-developers) experiment with using the Aragon Stack. Second is a core dev team that will focus on developing the Aragon codebase, implementing features especially needed by the users. Both teams are advised by experienced members of Giveth and Aragon One teams and will work closely with each other.

We invite you to join us in building a better world!
