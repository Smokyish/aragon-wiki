<h2>Ensuring the success of decentralized organizations</h2>

<h3>Putting the power back into the hands of the users</h3>

> The Aragon Network will decentralize its governance by gradually handing over control of the project to its users

The Aragon Network will establish additional services for the organizations taking advantage of what Aragon Core provides

Our mission is to make the Aragon Network an autonomous organization itself, which is managed by the people using it for their mutual prosperity

## Imagine a nation without land and borders

!!! abstract "<h3>A digital jurisdiction</h3>"

    > Aragon Network will be the first community governed decentralized organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction, an online decentralized court system that isnâ€™t bound by traditional artificial barriers such as national jurisdictions or the borders of a single country

    Aragon organizations can be upgraded seamlessly using our aragonOS architecture. They can solve disputes between two parties by using the decentralized court system, a digital jurisdiction that operates only online and utilizes your peers to resolve issues

    The Aragon Network Token, ANT, puts the power into the hands of the people participating in the operation of the Network. Every single aspect of the Network will be governed by those willing to make an effort for a better future
