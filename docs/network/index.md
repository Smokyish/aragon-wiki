# Aragon Network

The [Aragon Network](https://aragon.org/network) is the world's first digital jurisdiction, and is itself operated as a decentralized organization using Aragon. It was [first described](https://blog.aragon.org/introducing-the-aragon-network-20b998e2caba/) in the Aragon Network whitepaper, the [first version](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper/tree/v1) of which was released to the public on April 14, 2017. On May 25, 2018, [v2](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper/blob/c00053e45e9f131131f9e2ae34167f6068ed32c8/README.md) of the Aragon Network whitepaper was released, followed by a [v3 release](https://github.com/aragon/whitepaper/blob/1b8d87ab7e41a368d74a39320ec63a26535ecb03/README.md) of the whitepaper on May 10, 2019.

The Aragon Network is governed by Aragon Network Token (ANT) holders subject to [AGP-1: The Aragon Governance Proposal Process](governance/index.md). Through the governance process, ANT holders continually improve the functioning of the Network and allocate funds to support the development of the Network. The first vote ever held by the Aragon Network on the Ethereum mainnet was [using the Survey app](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-launches-survey-app-on-mainnet-ed5eefeb66f5/), and [started on May 28, 2018](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf9e35a907d1bcea399e2c3a95075a39262d95a2b1fa2d7d12c68c7ad1e07c8bf). Later that year, ANT holders [voted to approve](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote/) AGP-1: The Aragon Governance Proposal Process.

On January 24, 2019 ANT holders participated in Aragon Network Vote #1, the first vote held under the newly approved Aragon Governance Proposal Process. The results of the vote were finalized on January 26, 2019 and officially announced on the [Aragon blog](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-1/) and at [AraCon 2019](https://youtu.be/ELIWP0qr_jU?t=918) on January 28, 2019 by Aragon One Comms Team Lead John Light.

Also at [AraCon 2019](https://aracon.one), Aragon project co-founder and Aragon One CEO Luis Cuende [announced](https://youtu.be/oND8XJ-bvB8?t=389) that the Aragon Network would launch on the Ethereum mainnet by the end of 2019. Aragon One Research team members Bingen Eguzkitza and Luke Duncan also gave [a talk at AraCon 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7MpgpiAyAs&list=PLdbM67oXoBoaAhNLWHj_lJNkoXH_Jqkk2&index=3) describing how the Aragon Network will work once it goes live.
