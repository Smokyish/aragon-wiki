[Aragon One](https://blog.aragon.one/introducing-aragon-one-b14dd804c5ce/) is one of the development teams working on Aragon. [Aragon One](https://aragon.one/) is a company that encompasses the foundational team working on the [Aragon Project](https://aragon.org). The company is currently established in Switzerland, although we want it to function as a DAO as much as possible.

We want Aragon One to be a small team, with high-bandwidth and trust between individuals. Keeping the team small will help us prevent many of the problems that arise when growing too much and too fast.

Funding for the company will come in a form of a grant given by the project's non-profit entity, in similar terms to the ones that the entity will provide to future teams that will be working on the project as well.
