    1. **Submit Application**
    We'll review your application and we may ask you for more info.
    2. **Initial Interview**
    If there's a potential fit, we'll schedule a call.
    3. **Challenge**
    We'll ask you to solve a real problem.
    4. **Meet the team**
    If we liked your submission, you'll chat with Luis, Jorge and/or Chris.
    6. **Offer**
    If we see a full match, we'll extend you an offer.
    7. **Trial**
