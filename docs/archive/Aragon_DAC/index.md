# Aragon DAC

<img src="../design/DAC/logo/Logo_ad.png" style="width:75%">

> We are dedicated to making decentralized governance easy to implement in the real world by real people.

> To do this we will focus on on improving the Aragon Ecosystem from the user’s perspective, and are actively collaborating with Aragon.one and the Aragon Foundation to build solutions towards this goal.

The Aragon Foundation and [Giveth](https://giveth.io) are proud to announce the launch of Aragon DAC, a [Decentralized Altruistic Community](https://medium.com/giveth/giveth-introduces-decentralized-altruistic-communities-dacs-d1155a79bdc4) on the Giveth platform that will work on building out core Aragon infrastructure from the end user's perspective.

The second team that will be working on the Aragon stack is a community focused effort led by the [Giveth community](https://wiki.giveth.io/dac/mission/#giveth-is-a-decentralized-altruistic-community-dac-focused-on-using-blockchain-technology-for-good-to-make-the-world-a-better-place): the Aragon DAC will kick off with **two specific projects or 'Campaigns'**: one focusing purely on development, the other on experimentation with the Aragon stack. Experienced members of Giveth and Aragon One will help kickstart the Aragon DAC initiatives on a voluntary and part-time basis, with the clear goal of steering the DAC towards full independence.

Funding for the community will come in a form of a grant given by the project's non-profit entity, in similar terms to the ones that the entity will provide to [Aragon One](#aragon-one) and future teams that will be working on the project as well.

## The Development Campaign
The Development Campaign is staffed with full-time and part-time people that create and tackle issues in the full Aragon Stack and is managed in a semi-decentralized way, while collaborating heavily with the Aragon One team and the R&D Campaign. This Campaign is spearheaded by Quazia, Social Coding Circle Lead at Giveth.

The Development Campaign will tackle issues in the Aragon Stack to improve the user and dev experience, with a special focus on integrating user feedback to create and improve tools for building new types of organizations with the Aragon Stack.

Major Goals:

- Focus on the Aragon stack from the end user’s perspective prioritizing specific user features over research; in other words, this campaign hopes to improve how the tech is used as opposed to how the tech can be used
- Assist in the maintenance of and potentially “own” https://hack.aragon.org/
- Focus on tutorials with hands on and video components to illustrate the development process or the use of new features
- Experiment with more dynamic incentive structure to bridge the gap between the Bounty/RewardDAO compensation approaches and traditional salary
- Much of the direction of development will be dictated by users and an immediate focus will be placed on developing the tools necessary to allow ANT holders to participate deciding in future improvements or changes
- Work closely with the Community R&D Campaign to prioritize and implement user facing needs specifically in the context of charitable organizations
- Co-ordinate with other Aragon development pods to ensure that external issues added to Aragon repositories are handled in a timely manner in order to ensure an optimal user experience
- Collect developer experiences to better improve the ability for developers to create better dev tools
- Take ownership in aragon.js, the Dev CLI, and other core pieces of infrastructure.
- Help mentor Nest supported projects


To achieve these goals, we will create an agile core team of 4-6 people with a development process structured around frequent standups and short code sprints.

## The Community R&D Campaign
The Community R&D Campaign will focus on helping end users (=non-developers) experiment with using the Aragon Stack. #Dogfooding is the name of the game! This team is stewarded by Griff Green, Giveth's Governance Circle Lead.

The campaign is focused on helping normal end users have fun and success building organizations with the Aragon Stack.

Various Goals of this Campaign:

- Create Documentation to aid USERS (not devs) in designing, creating and deploying their own DAOs.
- Help manage community forum for Aragon users to work through problems and create issues.
- Create a culture that lends itself to collaboration, decentralization, and working towards constant improvement with a playful attitude.
- Integrate Aragon into the Giveth DApp with the first goal being to replace the campaign manager (Luke) with a DAO, then the Delegate of the DAC (Griff) with a DAO
- Document the governance experiments using the Aragon and Giveth stacks especially with non profits on Giveth.
- Work closely with the development campaign to prioritize and implement user facing needs.
- Helping to manage a bounty system overall and using bounties to create documentation
- Push the RewardDAO AragonApp MVP
- Traveling and presenting Aragon Development
- Manage social media outreach
- Create medium/Reddit posts about user success stories

To achieve these goals we will build a core team that will recruit and reward the large contributor base supporting this cause. All of our accounting will be done in an open way using the Giveth DApp and we hope to continually evolve our own governance structure using Aragon tools #dogfooding.
